This is a study project made during Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity.
The goal of this project is to present my prowess in creating responsive web pages which would look great on any device.
This is not yet a real portfolio (:

The project is built on the base of Foundation framework. Main working files are "index.html" and "style.css". Foundation provides you with a _settings.scss file which declares default style of a page. Some changes (i.e. colors of the page) were made there.

Instructions:
To work on this project, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Then open the project folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd FSND-portfolio
npm install
bower install
```
3. Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```
To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
